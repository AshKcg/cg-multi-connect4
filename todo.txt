config:
statement:
    Steal move (Explanation; Usage: STEAL word, or an integer constant that comes in available actions)
    Player viewer message must now be appended after using a space
    Also, the number of maximum turns (now it is num_cells + 1)

src:
Player: getAction needs to be updated
    As Steal is a word, player must separate viewer message with a space
    The Steal move will have to be converted to an integer so that Action and Referee need not be changed
        (for now constant is -2)  // can also have -1 (so use a constant variable)
Connect4Board:
    Implement the steal move
    Take care of the number of max turns
    Minor change in Input:
        Second player must get additional available action for the first time, which is, the integer constant of STEAL
        All other inputs do not change now that the action is converted to the required integer constant which will
        automatically be sent to the first player
InvalidAction:
    Add a new type: Steal move is not applicable in this turn
