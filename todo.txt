config:
statement:
    Steal move (Explanation; Usage: STEAL word, or an integer constant that comes in available actions)
    Player viewer message must now be appended after using a space
    Also, the number of maximum turns (now it is num_cells + 1)

src:
Player: getAction needs to be updated
    As Steal is a word, player must separate viewer message with a space
    The Steal move will have to be converted to an integer so that Action and Referee need not be changed
        (for now constant is -2)  // can also have -1 (so use a constant variable)
Connect4Board:
    Implement the steal move
    Take care of the number of max turns
    Changes in Input:

    Add a new type: Steal move is not applicable in this turn
